# About Valley
Valley is the [r/egg-irl](https://reddit.com/r/egg-irl) official Discrod server. We are one of the largest trans servers and we aim to provide a safe home and community to those who struggle with their gender (or don't!). Weather you're an egg, cis, non-binary, transmasc, transfem, transandrogyne, genderfluid, femby, mascby, agender, gender non-conforming, intersex, something else, or just plain confused, you are welcome here!

The transative property of gender often comes experimentation with sexuality as well. We fully support all types of members from the LGBTQIA+ community.

## Valley Coops
Along with our main server community, we allow users to propose and run their own mini communities based on various interests. We roughly have around 50 different communities to choose from. Come find new friends that love the same things as you and share your love!

# About the Mod Team
Hello! We are the Valley Discord Server Mod Team!

We plan to put introductions from all our mods on here at some point but for now just enjoy this blank page.
